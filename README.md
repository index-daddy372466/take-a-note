This application enables the user to write notes on a limited & secure session. User login is not required because each session's id is associated with the current date-time the session is create, then hashed before storing into the database.
Sessions expire 30 minutes after the session begins.
upon expiration, database functions **DELETE** rows of the expired user's id within the users table.
In addition, notes are deleted 30 minutes after a note is created.
This project/Application is free for public use.
